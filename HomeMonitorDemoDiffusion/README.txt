1. Start the virtual box image. You should not need to log in, but if you do the username/password is diffusion/welcome1
2. Double-click the Diffusion shortcut on the desktop. This will start Diffusion.
3. Double-click the Oracle Stream Explorer shortcut on the desktop. This will start Oracle Stream Explorer.
4. Click on the Firefox icon to start Firefox.
5. Open http://localhost:8080/sensors/index.html in Firefox - this is available in the bookmarks
6. You should see a graph of room temperatures and a diagram with the rooms and current temperature marked.
7. Change the heating threshold high/low to set the bounds of temperature. The graphs should adjust as OEP uses
the synthetic data to turn the heating on and off. The synthetic data is generated by Diffusion which sends it
to OEP for processing. The processing results in actions which are published back to Diffusion and hence to the
javascript application for visualization.
8. The lighting threshold has no effect - the lighting will just switch on and off on a periodic basis.
9. If you want you can start eclipse from the Desktop to show the EPN.
10. Open http://localhost:8080/console/ to show the diffusion console (admin/password)
11. Open http://localhost:9002/wlevs/ to see the OEP visualizer (diffusion/welcome1)
